## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a CSV dataset using Jupyter Notebook. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to:

> Load and preprocess the CSV data. <br>
> Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.<br>
> Perform sentiment analysis to extract sentiment polarity.<br>
> Visualize the results using plots and charts.<br>

## Required Libraries

* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy: For numerical operations.
* nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks.
* matplotlib: For data visualization.
* seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
